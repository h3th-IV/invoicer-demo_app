# Invoicing Application

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/h3th-IV/invoicer-demo_app.git`
2. Navigate to the root directory: `cd invoicer-demo_app`
3. Run Docker Compose: `docker-compose up --build`
4. Access the app:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000` (for testing endpoints)


## Features Completed
- Invoice Creation Form (autogenerated number, validation, total calc)
- Invoice List View (table, sorting)
- Mark Invoice as Paid/Unpaid (toggle)
- Client Management (CRUD)
- AI-Powered Query (left out because of time)

## Features Not Completed
- PDF Export
- (Others TBD based on time)

## Thought Process and Prioritization
- Focused on must-have features for a demoable foundation.
- Prioritized AI-Powered Query for hiring advantage.
- Used Node.js/Express.js, MongoDB, and React for speed and familiarity.
- Traded off advanced features (e.g., multi-currency) to meet time constraints.

## What I'd Do Next
- Implement overdue detection with visual highlights.
- Add PDF export using a library like `pdfkit`.
- Enhance AI queries with more sophisticated logic.

## Known Limitations/Bugs
- Initial setup bugs (TBD after testing).
- AI integration depends on API key availability.

## Stack
- Backend: Node.js/Express.js
- Frontend: React
- Database: MongoDB
- Containerization: Docker
