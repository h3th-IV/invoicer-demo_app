# AI-Powered Query Integration Plan

## Overview
Implement an LLM integration using OpenAI API to allow users to query invoice and client data using natural language. This will provide intelligent insights and recommendations based on the data.

## Target Queries to Handle

1. **Product Recommendation**: "Given the purchase history of my clients, suggest who is the most likely to buy <Product/Service X>"
2. **Cross-sell/Up-sell**: "For each customer, based on their purchase history, suggest one or more products I can likely cross-sell or up-sell to them"
3. **Churn Risk Analysis**: "Which clients show signs of churn risk based on declining invoice volume or delayed payments?"
4. **Pattern Analysis**: "Identify clients whose buying patterns have changed significantly in the last 3 months"

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. New API Endpoints
```
POST /ai/query - Submit natural language query
GET /ai/analytics/summary - Get data summary for AI context
```

#### 2. New Service Layer
- `aiService.js` - OpenAI API integration and query processing
- `analyticsService.js` - Data aggregation and analysis
- `queryProcessor.js` - Query parsing and response formatting

#### 3. New Models (if needed)
- `Query.js` - Store query history and results
- `Analytics.js` - Store computed analytics data

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. New Pages
- `AIQuery.js` - Main AI query interface
- `QueryHistory.js` - View past queries and results
- `Insights.js` - Display AI-generated insights

#### 2. New Components
- `QueryInput.js` - Natural language input component
- `QueryResult.js` - Display query results
- `InsightCard.js` - Display individual insights
- `AnalyticsChart.js` - Visualize AI insights

## Data Analysis Functions

### 1. Client Purchase Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze client purchase patterns
function analyzeClientPurchases(clientId, timeframe) {
  // Get all invoices for client
  // Calculate purchase frequency, amounts, items
  // Identify trends and patterns
  // Return structured analysis
}
```

### 2. Product Recommendation Engine
```javascript
// Recommend products based on purchase history
function recommendProducts(clientId) {
  // Get client's purchase history
  // Find similar clients
  // Identify products they bought
  // Calculate recommendation scores
  // Return top recommendations
}
```

### 3. Churn Risk Assessment
```javascript
// Assess churn risk for clients
function assessChurnRisk() {
  // Calculate payment delays
  // Analyze invoice volume trends
  // Identify declining engagement
  // Return risk scores and reasons
}
```

### 4. Pattern Change Detection
```javascript
// Detect significant changes in buying patterns
function detectPatternChanges(timeframe = '3months') {
  // Compare recent vs historical data
  // Calculate change percentages
  // Identify significant deviations
  // Return change analysis
}
```

## OpenAI Prompt Engineering

### Base Context Prompt
```
You are an AI assistant for an invoicing system. You have access to the following data:
- Client information (name, contact, status)
- Invoice data (amounts, dates, items, status)
- Purchase history and patterns

Analyze the data and provide insights based on the user's query. Focus on:
1. Actionable recommendations
2. Data-driven insights
3. Clear explanations
4. Specific examples from the data
```

### Query-Specific Prompts

#### Product Recommendation
```
Based on the client purchase data provided, identify which clients are most likely to buy [PRODUCT]. 
Consider:
- Similar purchase patterns
- Client spending habits
- Product category preferences
- Purchase frequency

Provide specific client names and reasoning for each recommendation.
```

#### Cross-sell/Up-sell
```
For each client, analyze their purchase history and suggest products for cross-selling or up-selling.
Consider:
- Items they've already purchased
- Complementary products
- Higher-value alternatives
- Purchase timing patterns

Provide specific product recommendations with reasoning.
```

#### Churn Risk
```
Analyze the client data to identify clients at risk of churning.
Look for:
- Declining invoice volumes
- Payment delays
- Reduced engagement
- Negative trends

Provide risk scores and specific reasons for each at-risk client.
```
